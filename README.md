# Laser Cut Clock

My Dad had a copy of this book, _Make Your Own Working Paper Clock_.  We never got around to building it when I was a kid, but it always fascinated me.  I got older and learned about laser cutting and thought it would be fun to build a lasercut clock so I looked up this book and decided to build that clock but with redesigned, computer cut parts.

This repo has some of the work I'm doing to capture the designs

To generate an svg file of the clock components:

```bash
erb clock.svg.erb > clock.svg
```
